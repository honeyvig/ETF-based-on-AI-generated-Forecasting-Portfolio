# ETF-based-on-AI-generated-Forecasting-Portfolio
Scanning the news and articles related to the forcasting of the main sectors of the economy and adjust the composition of the
Portfolio of ETFs to try catching a better performance than staying passively invested in the World index
===========================
To build a portfolio of ETFs based on AI-generated forecasting, you can follow a structured process that includes:

    News and Article Scraping: Use web scraping tools to gather news and articles related to economic sectors and market trends.
    Sentiment Analysis: Analyze the sentiment of the collected data using NLP models.
    Forecasting Model: Use AI models to predict sector performance based on the sentiment and historical data.
    Portfolio Adjustment: Dynamically rebalance the portfolio composition of ETFs based on the predictions.
    Performance Monitoring: Evaluate the performance against benchmarks like the World Index.

Below is a Python code outline for implementing the solution:
Code Outline
1. Web Scraping for News and Articles

Use requests and BeautifulSoup to scrape relevant articles from financial websites or APIs like Alpha Vantage or NewsAPI for structured data.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def scrape_news(sector):
    url = f'https://example-financial-news.com/search?q={sector}'
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    
    # Extract headlines and summaries
    articles = []
    for item in soup.find_all('article'):
        headline = item.find('h2').text
        summary = item.find('p').text
        articles.append({'headline': headline, 'summary': summary})
    
    return articles

2. Sentiment Analysis

Use pre-trained NLP models like transformers or TextBlob to perform sentiment analysis on scraped articles.

from transformers import pipeline

def analyze_sentiment(articles):
    sentiment_analyzer = pipeline("sentiment-analysis")
    sentiments = []

    for article in articles:
        combined_text = article['headline'] + " " + article['summary']
        result = sentiment_analyzer(combined_text)
        sentiments.append(result[0])  # Store sentiment score and label
    
    return sentiments

3. Forecasting Sector Performance

Use historical ETF data and sentiment scores to forecast performance using a regression model or an LSTM model for time-series forecasting.

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

def forecast_sector_performance(historical_data, sentiment_scores):
    # Combine historical ETF data and sentiment scores
    data = historical_data.copy()
    data['sentiment_score'] = sentiment_scores

    # Train a model to predict performance
    X = data[['historical_return', 'sentiment_score']]
    y = data['future_return']
    model = RandomForestRegressor()
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Forecast future returns
    predictions = model.predict(X)
    return predictions

4. Portfolio Optimization

Use optimization techniques (e.g., cvxpy or PyPortfolioOpt) to adjust the ETF weights dynamically.

from pypfopt import EfficientFrontier, expected_returns, risk_models

def optimize_portfolio(predictions, current_weights, covariance_matrix):
    # Calculate expected returns and covariance
    mu = expected_returns.mean_historical_return(predictions)
    S = risk_models.sample_cov(predictions)

    # Optimize portfolio
    ef = EfficientFrontier(mu, S)
    weights = ef.max_sharpe()
    cleaned_weights = ef.clean_weights()
    
    return cleaned_weights

5. Performance Monitoring

Compare the portfolio's performance with a benchmark like the World Index.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def monitor_performance(portfolio_returns, benchmark_returns):
    plt.plot(portfolio_returns, label="Portfolio")
    plt.plot(benchmark_returns, label="World Index")
    plt.legend()
    plt.title("Portfolio vs World Index Performance")
    plt.show()

End-to-End Integration

def main():
    sectors = ['technology', 'healthcare', 'finance', 'energy']
    portfolio = {}
    
    for sector in sectors:
        # Step 1: Scrape news
        articles = scrape_news(sector)
        
        # Step 2: Analyze sentiment
        sentiment_scores = analyze_sentiment(articles)
        
        # Step 3: Forecast sector performance
        historical_data = pd.read_csv(f'data/{sector}_historical.csv')  # Example CSV
        predictions = forecast_sector_performance(historical_data, sentiment_scores)
        
        # Step 4: Optimize portfolio
        current_weights = portfolio.get(sector, 0)
        covariance_matrix = historical_data.cov()
        portfolio[sector] = optimize_portfolio(predictions, current_weights, covariance_matrix)
    
    # Step 5: Monitor performance
    portfolio_returns = simulate_portfolio(portfolio)  # Simulate portfolio returns
    benchmark_returns = get_world_index_data()         # Fetch World Index returns
    monitor_performance(portfolio_returns, benchmark_returns)

Technologies Used

    Web Scraping: requests, BeautifulSoup.
    NLP for Sentiment Analysis: transformers (Hugging Face), TextBlob.
    Forecasting Models: scikit-learn, tensorflow for time-series models like LSTM.
    Portfolio Optimization: PyPortfolioOpt for dynamic asset allocation.
    Visualization: matplotlib for performance comparison.

Next Steps

    Data Sources:
        Use APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) for real-time market data.
        Use NewsAPI or similar for structured news data.

    Deployment:
        Deploy the solution to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure).
        Use CI/CD pipelines for continuous updates.

    Scalability:
        Add more ETFs and refine the model using fine-tuned AI/ML pipelines.
        Enhance optimization with multi-objective frameworks (risk and return).

This approach offers a structured framework for building and managing an AI-driven dynamic ETF portfolio.
